# 🐍 Snake Game in Python (Curses)

This is a **simple Snake Game** built using **Python** and the **curses** library.

## 📥 Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository or download the `snake.py` or `snake-remastered.py` file.

   git clone (https://github.com/iamdipayandutta/TermiSnake-.git)
   
   cd snake-game

2. Install required dependencies (curses is built-in for Linux/macOS, 
but for Windows, you need `windows-curses`).
   
   **For Linux/macOS:**
   sudo apt install python3
   
   **For Windows:**
   pip install windows-curses

## ▶️ How to Run
Run the Python script using:
python snake_game.py

## 🎮 Controls
- **Arrow Keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️)** → Move the snake.
- **P** → Pause the game.
- **R** → Restart after Game Over.
- **Q** → Quit the game.

## 🌟 Features
✅ Smooth movement with arrow keys.
✅ Food spawns randomly.
✅ Score tracking.
✅ Pause and Resume functionality.
✅ Restart option on Game Over.
✅ Increasing difficulty as score increases.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- If the game **doesn't run on Windows**, make sure you installed `windows-curses` (`pip install windows-curses`).
- If the terminal **doesn't display colors properly**, try running it in a **Linux/macOS terminal** or a supported terminal emulator (like Git Bash or Windows Terminal).
